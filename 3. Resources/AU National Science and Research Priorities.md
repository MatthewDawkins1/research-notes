- supporting healthy and thriving communities
- elevating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders knowledge systems
- protecting and restoring Australia’s environment
- building a secure and resilient nation.

### Whats the Key Finding/ Takeaway:

Possible avenues of alignment for my research interests.  

Transitioning to a net zero future has the critical research outcome:
- *"advancing critical technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), quantum and robotics to allow us to transition to net zero in environmentally responsible ways"*

Protecting and restoring Australia’s environment:
- *"tools and techniques to collect and analyse environmental data"*
- *"cumulative impacts of extractive and non-extractive uses of freshwater and marine resources"*

Building a secure and resilient nation:
- *"technologies that support Australian resilience to natural and human-induced challenges"*
- *"technology design frameworks (including for artificial intelligence) that increase democratic resilience and reduce risks to social cohesion, economic prosperity and national security"*
- *"predicting, detecting and responding to biosecurity threats and natural disasters"*
### Interesting Extracts:

These Priorities were published mid 2024 and will be refreshed every 5 years (2029).
### What don't I Currently Understand:

How to apply this to my research as i don't know my research gap :)
