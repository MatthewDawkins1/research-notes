Survey paper on the intersection between causal inference and deep learning in a large journal. 

---
### Whats the Key Finding/ Takeaway:

Key open questions:
1) Distinguishing between correlation and causation among variables is challenging in real-world tasks
2) Lack of publicly available bench-marking resources to train and evaluate causal models
3) Current work lacks comparison with equally causal-based approaches
4) It is necessary to raise the awareness of causal learning among researchers in related fields
5) Causal inference in AI
6) The next step in the development of AI:
7) Brain cognition in machine reasoning
8) Data distribution and recommender systems combined with inference
9) Physics-informed causal inference
10) Data-independent causal models:
11) Causality assessment
12) Interpretability of causal learning
13) The impact of AI with reasoning ability
### Interesting Extracts:
Mentions causal discovery. 

### What don't I Currently Understand:

Causal inference more generally.
