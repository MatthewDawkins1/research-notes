Paper creates a model for handling semi-parametric specification of non-linear trend and random effects using Bayesian penalised spline and Dirichlet process mixture methods

---
### Whats the Key Finding/ Takeaway:

Whilst this is not a true GAM, it does show that there is some potential in using a DPM as a prior distribution for additive mixed models. 

### Interesting Extracts:

No access to full paper :(

### What don't I Currently Understand:

- Sampling method for DPM
- the paper itself as no access :(
