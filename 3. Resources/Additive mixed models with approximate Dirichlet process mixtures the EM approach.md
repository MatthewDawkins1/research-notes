Paper looks to be an extension of [[Additive mixed models with Dirichlet process mixture and P-spline priors]] using a different method fitting to data (Expectation Maximisation).

### Whats the Key Finding/ Takeaway:

For Bayesian Semi-Parametric models there may be better sampling algos than just a simple mcmc. 
### Interesting Extracts:

```
As random effects distribution an approximate Dirichlet process mixture is proposed that is based on the truncated version of the stick breaking presentation of the Dirichlet process and provides a Gaussian mixture with a data driven choice of the number of mixture components. The main advantage of the specification is its ability to identify clusters of subjects with a similar random effects structure.
```
### What don't I Currently Understand:

- Sampling method for DPM
- the paper itself as no access :(
