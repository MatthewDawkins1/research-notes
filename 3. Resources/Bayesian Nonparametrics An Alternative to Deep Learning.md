Review paper on Bayesian Nonparametrics (BNP) through the lens of it being an alternative to deep learning, with a focus on Dirichlet Processes and similar random processes. 

---
### Whats the Key Finding/ Takeaway:

That there is likely to be opportunities in applying BNP to problems which typically have been solved using Deep Learning. 

### Interesting Extracts:
```
Here are a few applications that BNP excels over deep neural networks:
- Handling Uncertainty
- Scalability and Robustness
- Model Interpretability
- Incorporating Prior Knowledge
- Flexibility in Model Complexity
```

```
By leveraging the complementary strengths of BNP methods and deep learning architectures, researchers can develop more versatile, interpretable, and reliable models for a wide range of applications.

- Hybrid Models
- Interpretable Deep Learning
- Uncertainty Quantification
- Small Data and Few-shot Learning
- Robustness and Adversarial Defense
- Scalability and Efficiency
```

### What don't I Currently Understand:

- Bayesian Nonparametrics generally 
- The Dirichlet process on a deep fundamental level

### Notes:
Need to dig into this paper more once I better understand the underlying principles :)
