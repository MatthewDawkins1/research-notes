**Key Resources:** 
- [[Bayesian Nonparametrics An Alternative to Deep Learning]] Investigating BNP in the context of flexible models
- [[Dirichlet Process Mixtures of Generalized Linear Models]] An initial example of how Dirichlet mixtures of simple modes (GLM) can handle non-linearity and non-constant variance.
- [[Additive mixed models with Dirichlet process mixture and P-spline priors]] Some basic building blocks of GAM
- [[Additive mixed models with approximate Dirichlet process mixtures the EM approach]] Same as above but using a different algo (EM).

Given that GPs have been shown to be effectively  integrated with GAMs, explore combining the other main model in Bayesian nonparametrics (Dirichlet Process) with GAMs.

**Open Question:** Why hasn't this been fleshed out properly??

### Possible Research Question/s:
```
Can Bayesian Non-Parametric modeling, specifically Dirichlet Processes be used to improve the predictions created by Generalised Addative Models?
```
### Areas for Investigation:
#### Non-parametric Random Effects
Incorporating DPMs into mixed models is a well-studied area. For instance, semiparametric additive mixed models use DPMs for random effect distributions, which could generalize to GAM frameworksâ€‹. Explicit application to the random effects in GAMs is rare, though the concept is conceptually straightforward.

#### Residual Modeling
Using DPMs to model residuals has been explored in Bayesian hierarchical models. For example, modeling error distributions in regression frameworks with nonparametric priors is common.Direct integration of DPM residual modeling into GAM structures is less common but represents a logical extension.

#### Dynamic Priors for Smoothing Functions
Techniques such as spatially adaptive smoothing in Bayesian settings have some overlap, but DPM-based clustering for smooth terms in GAMs is not widely seen in the literature.

#### Dynamic Response Distributions
Bayesian methods for nonparametric density estimation, such as DPMs for response distributions, are robust. They are often paired with linear or hierarchical models.

#### Heirachical Extensions to GAMs
Hierarchical structures with nonparametric priors, such as DPMs for nested or grouped data, are explored in Bayesian nonparametrics. These ideas are applicable but rarely studied in the explicit GAM context. Hierarchical GAMs with DPM-driven random effects are an area needing further development.

### Possible Contributions:
#### Cluster-Specific Additive Components
**Idea:** Use DPMs to partition data into clusters, each with its own additive model. For instance, a DPM could define clusters of observations (e.g., groups of patients or regions), and a GAM could be fit within each cluster.
 
**Implementation:** The DPM assigns cluster memberships based on covariates or outcomes, and the additive components are modeled conditionally within each cluster. This is particularly useful in situations with multimodal or heterogeneously distributed data.
#### Dirichlet Process Priors on Basis Coefficients

**Idea:** In GAMs, spline functions are parameterized by basis functions. Instead of using fixed priors (e.g., Gaussian), assign a DPM prior to the coefficients of the basis functions. This allows the model to adaptively group coefficients, potentially smoothing across regions or functional components.

**Implementation:** Use a stick-breaking construction for DPMs to model spline coefficients, ensuring the flexibility of smoothing adapts to data heterogeneity.
#### Nonparametric Interaction Models

**Idea:** Extend GAMs with nonparametric interaction terms modeled by DPMs. While GAMs typically model additive effects, DPMs could flexibly learn interaction structures that deviate from simple additive assumptions.

**Implementation:** Model interaction effects as a mixture of low-rank tensor product bases, with DPMs determining cluster-specific interaction structures.

#### Flexible Covariate-Response Relationships  

**Idea:** DPMs could model the relationship between covariates and response distributions in GAMs. For example, instead of assuming a fixed link function or distribution for the response, a DPM could define clusters of response behaviors based on covariate patterns.

**Implementation:** Use a hierarchical Bayesian framework where the response distribution parameters are modeled as clusters derived from a DPM. 

#### Dynamic Smoothing for Temporal or Spatial Data

**Idea:** In spatio-temporal GAMs, allow DPMs to cluster regions or time periods, assigning different smoothing functions to each cluster. This enables dynamic adaptability to local variations.

**Implementation:** Combine DPMs with spatial or temporal basis functions, fitting cluster-specific smooth terms.

#### DPMs for Model Selection

**Idea:** Use DPMs as a prior over potential models to automate the selection of additive components in a GAM. For instance, the DPM could determine which predictors or interactions are included based on posterior probabilities.

**Implementation:** Fit the model with a DPM prior on the inclusion probabilities of terms, effectively performing Bayesian model averaging over potential GAM formulations.

#### Mixture-of-GAMs Framework

**Idea:** Create a mixture-of-GAMs model, where each component of the mixture (defined by the DPM) is a GAM with potentially different additive terms or smoothness levels.

**Implementation:** A DPM determines the number and structure of clusters, and a GAM is fit within each cluster, combining predictions across components for the final output.
