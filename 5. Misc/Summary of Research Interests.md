This note acts as the guiding high level direction for my research, outlining the direction and thus general areas I would be interested in researching. 
## 1. Machine Learning:
#Machine-Learning  

Flexible models (i.e that can capture non-linearity) which allows us to make predictions or forecasts of real world phenomena based on data we have collected about said phenomena in the past.

## 2. Bayesian Methods:
#Bayesian-Methods 

A paradigm for performing statistical inference under uncertainty that represents said uncertainty directly probability distributions. Probability is then viewed as a rational measure of uncertainty conditioned on our beliefs prior to an experiment and the data collected from said experiment.

## 3. Decision Optimisation:
#Descision-Optimisation

The process of modelling a real world decision making problem as a mathematical model and then applying a variety of optimisation algorithms to find an optimal solution.
